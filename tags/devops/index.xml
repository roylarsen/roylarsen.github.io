      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new job! So, as of 20171009, I&amp;rsquo;m in my last week of work at Hachette Book Group. Next week I start my new role as DevOps Engineer at Mobile Heartbeat!
I&amp;rsquo;m an equal mix of excited, scared, and a little bummed.
 Excited because this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been woring towards for a couple years now (the huge pay bump doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt) Scared because it&amp;rsquo;ll be one of my first more senior roles I&amp;rsquo;ve had Bummed because I&amp;rsquo;m leaving Downtown Boston and I&amp;rsquo;ll be leaving my friends at HBG  This job will be a great platform to really start developing my skills in the DevOps space.</description>

      <description>A Poorly Written Intro to Terraform So, I&amp;rsquo;m probably late to this party. Very late.
I still have a lot to play around with, but after creating and destroying some Digital Ocean droplets, I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to see the power and utility of this tool (it&amp;rsquo;s fun when those things are easily seen right away).
I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty firm believer that Hashicorp deserves their reputation in the Devops space. Everyone uses at least some of their tools.</description>
