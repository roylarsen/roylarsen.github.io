      <description>Well, not really. I have a pretty decent idea of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.. Trust me, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this (mostly) I&amp;rsquo;ve also figured out how to do images in Hugo, #dealwtithit
mhqa I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on authoring a tool in python, and that&amp;rsquo;s been fun to work on. It&amp;rsquo;s currently pretty limited in scope, but soon I should be able to start building things out and really start doing some fun Continuous Deployment/Delivery stuff for our QA people.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new job! So, as of 20171009, I&amp;rsquo;m in my last week of work at Hachette Book Group. Next week I start my new role as DevOps Engineer at Mobile Heartbeat!
I&amp;rsquo;m an equal mix of excited, scared, and a little bummed.
 Excited because this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been woring towards for a couple years now (the huge pay bump doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt) Scared because it&amp;rsquo;ll be one of my first more senior roles I&amp;rsquo;ve had Bummed because I&amp;rsquo;m leaving Downtown Boston and I&amp;rsquo;ll be leaving my friends at HBG  This job will be a great platform to really start developing my skills in the DevOps space.</description>
