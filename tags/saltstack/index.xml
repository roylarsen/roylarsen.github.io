      <description>Saltstack gitfs This is mostly notes for myself, but I wanted to write up an easy reference.
basics This is to get a basic setup with a map from saltenv to git branch.
This requires some basic knowlege of saltstack concepts like pillar, salt environments.
My setup is pretty simplistic, I have two main branches: master and dev. The branches are present in the state and pillar repos. Top files are managed per-repo, per-branch (there are probably better ways of handling it, but this is fine for right now).</description>

      <description>Well, not really. I have a pretty decent idea of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.. Trust me, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this (mostly) I&amp;rsquo;ve also figured out how to do images in Hugo, #dealwtithit
mhqa I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on authoring a tool in python, and that&amp;rsquo;s been fun to work on. It&amp;rsquo;s currently pretty limited in scope, but soon I should be able to start building things out and really start doing some fun Continuous Deployment/Delivery stuff for our QA people.</description>

      <description>Proxmox + salt-cloud = &amp;lt;kinda3 So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting salt-cloud playing nicely with Proxmox. The biggest issue I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far is within salt-cloud&amp;rsquo;s proxmox driver is more of a limitation within proxmox itself.
Unless you statically assign you IP address, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to see your IP address in the GUI or in the standard salt-cloud query to your hypervisor. The proxmox driver also allows your to query DNS for the IP address of your machine.</description>

      <description>christmas. It&amp;rsquo;s December 17th. In a month and a half, I&amp;rsquo;ll have lived in the Boston area for a year.
What. I have one week left of work this year, then HBG is off for Christmas week.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on coming up with my projects for the week so I don&amp;rsquo;t get bored.
## hypervisor.
(proxmox and plex are now things in my env) I want to rebuild my lab Hypervisor.</description>
