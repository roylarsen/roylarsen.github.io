      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new job! So, as of 20171009, I&amp;rsquo;m in my last week of work at Hachette Book Group. Next week I start my new role as DevOps Engineer at Mobile Heartbeat!
I&amp;rsquo;m an equal mix of excited, scared, and a little bummed.
 Excited because this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been woring towards for a couple years now (the huge pay bump doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt) Scared because it&amp;rsquo;ll be one of my first more senior roles I&amp;rsquo;ve had Bummed because I&amp;rsquo;m leaving Downtown Boston and I&amp;rsquo;ll be leaving my friends at HBG  This job will be a great platform to really start developing my skills in the DevOps space.</description>

      <description>A Poorly Written Intro to Terraform So, I&amp;rsquo;m probably late to this party. Very late.
I still have a lot to play around with, but after creating and destroying some Digital Ocean droplets, I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to see the power and utility of this tool (it&amp;rsquo;s fun when those things are easily seen right away).
I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty firm believer that Hashicorp deserves their reputation in the Devops space. Everyone uses at least some of their tools.</description>

      <description>Proxmox + salt-cloud = &amp;lt;kinda3 So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting salt-cloud playing nicely with Proxmox. The biggest issue I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far is within salt-cloud&amp;rsquo;s proxmox driver is more of a limitation within proxmox itself.
Unless you statically assign you IP address, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to see your IP address in the GUI or in the standard salt-cloud query to your hypervisor. The proxmox driver also allows your to query DNS for the IP address of your machine.</description>

      <description>Running a certificate authority is kinda annoying I recently had a developer come to me with a question about an error they were getting with the Requests Python Module.
The default for this module is to validate SSL certs. Makes sense, right? Validating SSL should be a thing you should do with HTTPS (you ARE using HTTPS for things, right?)
The issue came up where in development, the dev set validate to false so they could test hitting an API endpoint.</description>

      <description>christmas. It&amp;rsquo;s December 17th. In a month and a half, I&amp;rsquo;ll have lived in the Boston area for a year.
What. I have one week left of work this year, then HBG is off for Christmas week.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on coming up with my projects for the week so I don&amp;rsquo;t get bored.
## hypervisor.
(proxmox and plex are now things in my env) I want to rebuild my lab Hypervisor.</description>
